    <li>why do some people say we need to use sunscreen even in the winter? </li>
     
  <p> Did you know that we should actually wear UV sunscreen glasses everyday if we were exposed to the sunlight continuously in order to retain a normal vision, even when it is cloudy our body endures part of the light spectra we're exposed to and cannot even notice beside under summertime even when it is cloudy.

     <li> what does exfoliate mean and how many times do I have to do it? </li>
 <p>The exfoliating process is usually a skin care face treatment intended to slow down skin aging and counterbalance acne. An exfoliation is performed by using face scrubs on your skin, removing all dead skin cells on the surface of your skin caused by sweat,dirt, and reduces chances of clogged pores, etc...
    
Typically, the frequency you should be exfoliating will be based on your skin type and how does your skin tolerate the exfoliation basically. For a dry and sensitive skin we're talking about performing an exfoliation once every 10 days, and that's sufficient enough. For normal to combination skins, you might want to do it once a week whereas oily skins should exfoliate 2-3 times a week. Note that more aggressive exfoliations using chemical peels or microderma abrasion, should be performed every 4-6 weeks for all.
