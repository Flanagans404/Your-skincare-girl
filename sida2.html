    <li> how do I find out what skintype I have?</li>
    <p> there are five primary types of skin: oily, dry, normal, combination, and sensitive. Each skin type has its own type of characteristics and needs that affect the look and feel of it. When you get to know what skintype you really have- that is when you are really going to gte clear skin.
  The skin is based on the amount of sebum (oil) your skin produces. Skin’s oiliness can change over time and may also be influenced by different things such as stress, genetics, hormones, humidity, and the natural aging process.
You can try at home some things to help you understand what kind of skin you have in just 30 minutes: "the blotting sheet" method and the “watch and wait” method.  </p>
    <li>why do some people say we need to use sunscreen even in the winter? </li>
     
  <p> Did you know that we should actually wear UV sunscreen glasses everyday if we were exposed to the sunlight continuously in order to retain a normal vision, even when it is cloudy our body endures part of the light spectra we're exposed to and cannot even notice beside under summertime even when it is cloudy.
    
    The UV light A, B and C goes through everything and
    can damage your skin even thru fabrics in some areas of our world.
    As a matter of fact sunlight is greatly responsible for more than 90% of skin aging, participating in the apparition of skin cancer, wrinkles, brown spots, to name only some of its most challenging effects as the ozon layer gets thinner around the globe...

     <li> what does exfoliate mean and how many times do I have to do it? </li>
 <p>The exfoliating process is usually a skin care face treatment intended to slow down skin aging and counterbalance acne. An exfoliation is performed by using face scrubs on your skin, removing all dead skin cells on the surface of your skin caused by sweat,dirt, and reduces chances of clogged pores, etc...
    
Typically, the frequency you should be exfoliating will be based on your skin type and how does your skin tolerate the exfoliation basically. For a dry and sensitive skin we're talking about performing an exfoliation once every 10 days, and that's sufficient enough. For normal to combination skins, you might want to do it once a week whereas oily skins should exfoliate 2-3 times a week. Note that more aggressive exfoliations using chemical peels or microderma abrasion, should be performed every 4-6 weeks for all.

<li> What causes acne?</li>
    <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/11/15/17/41/sn7_acne.jpg"><p>Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.

The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.

Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.

 </p>
     <br></br>
  <li> how can I get rid of acne scars faster?</li>
    <p> Look for products with Sulforawhite (flower extract), Vitamin C, retinoids, or Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA). These ingredients have an effect to help the brighteing off acne scars fast. Alternatively, you can also find some natural ingredients at home that do the job just as well. We recommend raw honey (if you’ve got Manuka honey, that’s even better), coconut oil, aloe vera or turmeric.
