  <l>why do some people say we need to use sunscreen even in the winter?
     
  <p> Not everyody knows this but you should 
    actually wear sunscreen everyday, even 
    if it is cloudy or not. 
    The UV light goes through everything and
    can damage your skin at any time. 
    Sun damage is scientific proven that it is the 
    90% cause of aging(wrinkels etc.)
