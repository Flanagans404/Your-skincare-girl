School programming work 
2022-10-15 rev 0.1 
Hi there, i'm just trying to learn how to program in html 
and how to write css code by hand instead of generating it 
with a nice graphical interface where you just push on a button
to generate your code and magic happens :-)
Well, just learnt the hard way that i had to version control all of
my code before doing some modifications in it that are not saved yet...sobb..
got to rewrite my first page now that is so messed up with the text banner 
and find out button that was intended first to be in the middle of the image...
and i lost my underlined text title also...suck.
Putting here a note for this revision and to remember what i need to focus on next.
Anyway, did not find yet a good editor for writing my code. Using replit at school
to program a website that i may use one day if i can get this programming to work better
for me...oh well, patience is a virtue when developing a webbpage as it seems.
Baby steps for me so far..

nxt action:
recenter my text vertically and horizontally
recover my underlined title some way
get this index.html the way i had it before trying to put a button in the middle of the banner

rev0.2
added image file in repository of the main to work on the background with it 
and center my text and buttons over it vertically... 

rev0.3 of this file
wow. i succeed to do from github what i strive to do on replit like hell using pull from code on github.
i got for the first time a control over a modification on the index file i made by inadvertence on replit which
was immediatly detected during the pull from github on replit. thanks god i did not commit the change on replit
and used the revision from github. little me likee version control....:-)

rev 0.4 of this file
since i am testing my code on three different screens, computer, tablet and mobile phone so i noticed that i mess up a bit more with the current development view. no good. sooo.... i created more directories to take care of my configuration management nightmare. kind of tricky, i was first writing my code in a text file separated from replit misery with no undo,redo,revert buttons and then i realized along the way that whenever i was working on one of my three devices and changing my code, suddenly i changed the one for another device and was back to square one there...oops! no easy way to learn hey...so, i so glad i use github to version control my files. got me a spare life for my different devices versions...thank you github...save a lot of time actually. never realised before that cmvc had so much importance when coding...and i just write a few lines here :-) those who wrote the mobile games i fancy when i take the bus must have had a really big headache taking care of changes when using different devices or when working on different files as a team...anyway, this note to remenber to control the code development phases too!!!! created a directory work-in-progress to store files for a current device coding development, another latest backup when a verstion of the code for the three devices is stable and a directory freeze-this-backup to avoid touching by mistake the main code that was working fine and for which i felt happy to use as a start point for branching a new version...this is so far still a bit messy for me to get a grip on how to keep track the proper way of code changes and version control its development. gladfully, github helps a lot staying on track when merging changes. thank you to all the people there that made this cmvc place available for us newbies ;-)

rev 0.5 of this file. the branch which i am on right now is stable and i have no clue how to merge it back to my main. i wrote some extra text contents yesterday but took the wrong branch and need to update this one with it and then get everything back into the main...
