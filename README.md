School programming work 
2022-10-15 rev 0.1 
Hi there, i'm just trying to learn how to program in html 
and how to write css code by hand instead of generating it 
with a nice graphical interface where you just push on a button
to generate your code and magic happens :-)
Well, just learnt the hard way that i had to version control all of
my code before doing some modifications in it that are not saved yet...sobb..
got to rewrite my first page now that is so messed up with the text banner 
and find out button that was intended first to be in the middle of the image...
and i lost my underlined text title also...suck.
Putting here a note for this revision and to remember what i need to focus on next.
Anyway, did not find yet a good editor for writing my code. Using replit at school
to program a website that i may use one day if i can this programming to work better
for me...oh well, patience is a virtue when developing a webbpage as it seems.
Baby steps for me so far..

nxt action:
recenter my text vertically and horizontally
recover my underlined title some way
get this index.html the way i had it before trying to put a button in the middle of the banner

rev0.2
added image file in repository of the main to work on the background with it 
and center my text and buttons over it vertically...
